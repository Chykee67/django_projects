login view plan

use create_user to create user with attributes:
- username
- password
- email
- first_name
- last_name

User.objects.create_user(user attributes)

create a form that collects these details from the user during sign up -- edit SignUpForm

enable changing password using set_password:
u = User.objects.get(username="john")
u.set_password('new password')
u.save()


alternatively use authentication views and builtin forms to handle password changes

HOW TO USE SESSIONS IN DJANGO (3.3.8)

TO CARRY OUT ACTIONS FOR LOGGED IN OR NOT LOGGED IN USERS USING DJANGO SESSIONS:
for regular views:
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        .... (for logged in user)
    else:
        .... (for anonymous user)

for async views:
    user = await request.auser()

    if user.is_authenticated:
        ... (for logged in user)
    else:
        ... (for anonymous user)


How to log a user in:

from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login, logout

def my_view(request):

    username = request.POST['username']
    password = request.POST['password']

    user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)

    if user is not None:
        login(request, user)
        #redirect to a success page

    else:
        #return an error message

def logout_view(request):
    logout(request)
    #redirect to a success page.

for async views use aauthenticate and alogin()

login(request, user, backend=None) -- find details of the back end.
    checkout AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS (1092) IN settings.py
